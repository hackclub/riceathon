    <h2 class="headline">So What is a Rice / Ricing?</h2>
    <p>
      The term ‘rice’ is used to describe a person’s unix desktop where ‘ricing’ is when someone is customizing their
      desktop such as the icons, panels, or system interface. When it comes to ricing a tiling window manager though,
      the ricing of a user’s system becomes much more involved. Basic things such as the panel bar and application
      launcher must be configured by the user.

    <p>
      Set up <a href="https://hackatime.hackclub.com">Hakatime</a> and start ricing using the editor of your choice!
      Hakatime
      will need to be set up with the same email as your Hack Club Slack account in order to count. You will need to
      push your customization files to a Github repo once you're done. Afterward, <a
        href="https://github.com/hackclub/riceathon">submit a PR</a> to the Riceathon repo with an update to the
      members.json(check the formatting there for a template!)
